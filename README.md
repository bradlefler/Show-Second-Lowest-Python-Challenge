# Show-Second-Lowest-Python-Challenge

#### This is my attempt at solving the Nested Lists challenge from hackerrank.com using Quicksort. The challenge reads:

#### Given the names and grades for each student in a Physics class of  students, store them in a nested list and print the name(s) of any student(s) having the second lowest grade.

#### Note: If there are multiple students with the same grade, order their names alphabetically and print each name on a new line.

#### Input Format

#### The first line contains an integer, , the number of students.
#### The  subsequent lines describe each student over  lines; the first line contains a student's name, and the second line contains their grade.

#### Constraints

#### There will always be one or more students having the second lowest grade.
#### Output Format

#### Print the name(s) of any student(s) having the second lowest grade in Physics; if there are multiple students, order their names alphabetically and print each one on a new line.
